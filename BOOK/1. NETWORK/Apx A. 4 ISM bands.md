	-DEFINITION
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The ISM bands</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">are defined by</mark> the [ITU Radio Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations "ITU Radio Regulations") (article 5) in footnotes 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the [Radio Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_regulation_in_the_United_States "Radio regulation in the United States"). Individual countries' use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, (un- ?)licensed use of the bands is typically low. 

	--Regulation
In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by [Part 18](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5cd2e563d1078d1d7f4773f791173724&mc=true&node=pt47.1.18&rgn=div5) of the [Federal Communications Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") (FCC) rules, while [Part 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_15_(FCC_rules) "Part 15 (FCC rules)") contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. 
In Europe, the [ETSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETSI "ETSI") is responsible for regulating the use of [Short Range Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Range_Devices "Short Range Devices"), some of which operate in ISM bands.

	--Frequencie allocation
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to _Article 5_ of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-ITU-TFA-2)

![](ITU%20Frequency%20allocations.docx)

**Type A** (footnote 5.138) = frequency bands are designated for _ISM applications_. The use of these frequency bands for ISM applications shall be subject to special authorization by the administration concerned, in agreement with other administrations whose [radiocommunication services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocommunication_service "Radiocommunication service") might be affected. In applying this provision, administrations shall have due regard to the latest relevant ITU-R Recommendations.

**Type B** (footnote 5.150) = frequency bands are also designated for ISM applications. Radiocommunication services operating within these bands must accept harmful interference which may be caused by these applications.

ITU RR, (Footnote 5.280) = In Germany, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland, the band 433.05-434.79 MHz (center frequency 433.92 MHz) is designated for _ISM applications_. Radio communication services of these countries operating within this band must accept harmful interference which may be caused by these applications.

Footnote AU = Australia is part of ITU Region 3. The band 433.05 to 434.79 MHz is not a designated ISM band in Australia, however the operation of low powered devices in the radio frequency band 433.05 to 434.79 MHz is supported through Radio communications class licence for low interference potential devices (LIPDs).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-3)


	-HISTORY
The ISM bands were first established at the International Telecommunications Conference of the [ITU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU "ITU") in [Atlantic City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City "Atlantic City"), [1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947 "1947"). The American delegation specifically proposed several bands, including the now commonplace 2.4 GHz band, to accommodate the then nascent process of microwave heating;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-4) however, FCC annual reports of that time suggest that much preparation was done ahead of these presentations.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-5)

The report of the August 9th 1947 meeting of the Allocation of Frequencies committee[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-6) includes the remark:

"The delegate of the United States, referring to his request that the frequency 2450 Mc/s be allocated for I.S.M., indicated that there was in existence in the United States, and working on this frequency a diathermy machine and an electronic cooker, and that the latter might eventually be installed in transatlantic ships and airplanes. There was therefore some point in attempting to reach world agreement on this subject."

Radio frequencies in the ISM bands have been used for communication purposes, although such devices may experience interference from non-communication sources. In the United States, as early as 1958 Class D [Citizens Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Band "Citizens Band"), a Part 95 service, was allocated to frequencies that are also allocated to ISM. [1]

In the U.S., the FCC first made unlicensed [spread spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum "Spread spectrum") available in the ISM bands in rules adopted on May 9, 1985.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-7)

Many other countries later developed similar regulations, enabling use of this technology.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The FCC action was proposed by Michael Marcus of the FCC staff in 1980 and the subsequent regulatory action took five more years. It was part of a broader proposal to allow civil use of spread spectrum technology and was opposed at the time by mainstream equipment manufacturers and many radio system operators.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band#cite_note-8)
