COAXIAL CABLE

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Coaxial cable</mark> , or coax is a type of electrical cable <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consisting</mark> of an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inner conductor</mark>  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">surrounded by</mark> a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">concentric conducting shield</mark>, with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the two</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">separated</mark> by a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dielectric</mark>  (insulating material); many coaxial cables <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">also</mark> have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term "coaxial" refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis.

Coaxial cable is a type of [transmission line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line "Transmission line"), used to carry high-frequency [electrical signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_signal "Electrical signal") with low losses. It is used in such applications as telephone [trunk lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_line "Trunk line"), [broadband internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access "Internet access") networking cables, high-speed computer [data busses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing) "Bus (computing)"), [cable television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television "Cable television") signals, and connecting [radio transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter") and [receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver "Radio receiver") to their [antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio) "Antenna (radio)"). It differs from other [shielded cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shielded_cable "Shielded cable") because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.

In his 1880 British patent, [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") showed how coaxial cable could eliminate signal interference between parallel cables.

Coaxial cable was used in the first (1858) and following [transatlantic cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable "Transatlantic telegraph cable") installations, but its theory was not described until 1880 by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside"), who patented the design in that year (British patent No. 1,407).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable#cite_note-1)
