NETWORK COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

Communication protocols are vital to the functioning of a network. In fact, computer networks can't exist without these protocols. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">These protocols</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">formally</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">describe</mark> the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">formats</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rules</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">by which</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">data</mark> is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">transferred</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">over the network</mark>. Communication protocols also handle: 
-authentication
-error detection 
-syntax, synchronization and semantics (analog and digital communications must abide by to function).

-   **HTTP** – One of the most familiar protocols, _hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP)_ is often referred to as the protocol of the internet. HTTP is an application layer protocol that allows the browser and server to communicate.
-   **TCP** – _Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)_ separates data into packets that can be shared over a network. These packets can then be sent by devices like switches and routers to the designated targets.
-   **UDP** – _User Datagram Protocol (UDP)_ works in a similar way to TCP, sending packets of data over the network. The key difference between the two is that TCP ensures a connection is made between the application and server, but UDP does not.
-   **IRC** – _Internet Relay Chat (IRC)_ is a text-based communication protocol. Software clients are used to communicate with servers and send messages to other clients. This protocol works well on networks with a large number of distributed machines.
