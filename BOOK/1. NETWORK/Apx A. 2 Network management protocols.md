NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

Network management protocols <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">help define</mark> the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">policies</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procedures</mark> used to:
-monitor
-manage
-maintain network
-communicate these needs across the network (responsible for stable communication and optimal performance across the board).

See list of protocols and policies categorized by their function.

Generally, network managers can use a management protocol to troubleshoot connections between host and client devices. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Management protocols</mark> provide <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">network managers</mark> with:
-the host connection's status
-availability 
-packet or data loss, and other related information about the health of the network connection.

The policies managed by management protocols can be applied to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all</mark> devices on the network, including: computers, switches, routers and even servers.

Two of the most common types of network management protocols include _Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)_ and _Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)_.

-   **SNMP** – _Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)_ is used to monitor and manage network devices. This TCP-based protocol allows administrators to view and modify endpoint information to alter behavior of devices across the network. SNMP relies on the use of agents to collect and send data to an overarching SMNP manager, which in turn queries agents and gets their responses.
-   **ICMP** – _Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)_ is primarily used for diagnostic purposes. Managed devices on the network can use this protocol to send error messages, providing information regarding network connectivity issues between devices.
