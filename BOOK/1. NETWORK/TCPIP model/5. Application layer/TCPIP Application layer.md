At the application communication could be peer to peer (P2P), or more commonly Client to Server. Client server communication will typically be a client requesting something from a server and the server responding with an answer – either the requested resource or an error.

For example a web browser might communicate with a web server over HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). The client (web browser) will request a resource using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the server will then return this resource in its response – typically as an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) payload.
